description: Write a literature review by iterating over papers one at a time, accumulating summaries and themes across iterations.
---

Stateless sub-agents run per paper. The lead agent is a loop controller only.

**Shared files** (substitute for agent memory):
- `progress.txt`. tracks which papers are done/remaining
- `learning.txt`. cross-paper insights that compound across iterations
- `research_note.md`. human-readable summaries + themes
- `synthesis.md`. final cross-paper synthesis written after all papers are reviewed

## Lead Agent Loop

1. Init (first run only): copy `./agents/skills/templates/progress.txt`, `./agents/skills/templates/learning.txt`, `./agents/skills/templates/research_note.md`, and `./agents/skills/templates/synthesis.md` into the working directory if they don't exist. Also list all PDF files in the working directory and populate `progress.txt` with unchecked entries for each.
2. Spaw the Abstract Extraction Sub-Agent for each paper (can be parallelized). Wait for all to finish.
3. Spawn the Planning Agent to read abstracts and plan the review order. Wait for it to finish.
2. Pass `progress.txt` + `learning.txt` to a reading sub-agent.
3. Repeat until stop condition.

All sub-agents via Task tool (`general` or `mode: subagent`).

## Sub-Agent Instructions


### Abstract extraction sub-agent (runs once per paper, can be parallelized) 

- input: pdf of a paper 
- extract the text from the pdf by `python3 tools/extract_pdf.py <input.pdf>` 
- save it to "abstracts.txt" in the format: `filename.pdf: abstract text`. Append to the file if it already exists. Do not read the file, only append. 

### Planning sun-agents (runs once, after abstracts are extracted) 

- input: abstracts.txt
- read the abstracts and plan the order of papers to review. Prioritize foundational papers first. Update `progress.txt` to reflect the planned order (reorder entries if needed). Do not mark any paper as done at this stage.

### Reading sub-agent (runs once per paper, sequentially) 

1. Read `progress.txt` → pick next unreviewed paper (foundational first).
2. Read `learning.txt` to understand accumulated themes and gaps.
3. Extract the paper: `python3 tools/extract_pdf.py <input.pdf>`
4. Read `templates/research_note.md` for the format, then append a new entry to `research_note.md`. Do not read `research_note.md` itself. append only.
5. Append to `learning.txt` using the format in `templates/learning.txt`. Note contradictions explicitly. Avoid restating existing themes. Keep conversational tone, and speak laud as if explaining to a peer. Use LaTeX for equations, and define jargon when first introduced. Max 3 sentences/paragraph. Do not use bullet points or tables. Write in paragraph-based format. 
6. Update `progress.txt`: mark the paper done with a one-line note on what was produced.

Writing style: Clear and concise. Define jargon. LaTeX for equations (display mode for key ones). Max 3 sentences/paragraph. Narrative over bullets.

## Final Synthesis

After all papers are reviewed (no unchecked entries remain in `progress.txt`), run one final sub-agent:

1. Read `research_note.md` and `learning.txt`.
2. Read `templates/synthesis.md` for the format.

3. Write `synthesis.md` in the working directory, filling in all three sections (Synthesis, Contradictions, Open Questions). Do not append—write the complete file.

Writing style: same as sub-agents. Clear and concise. Define jargon. LaTeX for equations. Max 3 sentences/paragraph. Write in paragraph-based format. Do not use bullet points and table. Keep conversational tone. 

## Stop Conditions

- No unreviewed papers remain in `progress.txt` and `synthesis.md` has been written
- Worker fails repeatedly → escalate to user
- User cancels
